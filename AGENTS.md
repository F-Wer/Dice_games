# Repo Guidelines

- Use **2 spaces** for indentation in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- After making changes run `git status --short` to ensure there are no untracked files.
- Commit messages should be concise but descriptive.
- Keep code modular: each game mode belongs in its own script file.
- Prefer vanilla JS over heavy frameworks for this project.
